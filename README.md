# Fisher's Iris data Set
### By Lisa Murray

## Problem Statement

Research the Fisher's Iris data set and document the outcome in Python code.


## Background
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: 

1. Sepal Length (cm)
2. Sepal Width (cm)
3. Petal Length (cm)
4. Petal Width (cm)


The Liner discriminant was developed to distinguish species from each other. This data set is now the typical test case for many statistical classification techniques.

The use of this data set in cluster analysis however is not common, since the data set only contains two clusters with rather obvious separation. One of the clusters contains Iris setosa, while the other cluster contains both Iris virginica and Iris versicolor and is not separable without the species information Fisher used[1]. 



The sepals are the lower, or outermost part of the flower, they are usually green in color [2] however  in the case of the Iris flowers they are Purple, similar in colour to the petal. 
As per the images below.
